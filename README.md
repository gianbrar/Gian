# GianBot
The ultimate contest of robot training.
## The Purpose
GianBot is a robot that utilizes the chatterbot module in Python to act as a replica of myself.
## The Competition
The contestants all download a copy of GianBot. Programmers, or the TECHNOS in the tournament are free to edit the bot, as long as they stick to utilizing chatterbot. However, they must label themselves as TECHNOS and are not eligible for winning. The winner is judged based off of whatever factors the players decide upon. For example: most human.
